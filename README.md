I like this project because we can apply all the important concepts in it.
It was very challenging for me also
I found the section 2 part is very tricky  and section 3 part very challenging. Still i do not how to find the solution for that.
I really spent 4 hours for that two sections and still cannot able to do it
If I do more similar practices like this i think it would help.
